## Objectives
The project addresses the following key questions:
1. **Do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services?**
2. **Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?**

2. **Online Orders**: While online orders generally receive higher ratings, a majority of restaurants still rely on offline orders.
3. **Couples' Preferences**: Couples prefer restaurants with an average cost of 300 rupees for their dining.
4. **Order Trends**:
   - Dining restaurants primarily accept offline orders.
   - Cafes are more inclined to receive online orders.
5. **Ratings**: Offline orders tend to receive lower ratings compared to online orders.
